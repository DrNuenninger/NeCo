## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a quick architectural overview of the system. It is intended to capture the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.

### 1.2 Scope
This document describes the architecture of the NeCo Project.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations
|			Abbreviation									|	Explanation		|
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| MVVM | Model-View-ViewModel-Architecture |

### 1.4 References
n/a
### 1.5 Overview
The architectural details will be described in the following sections. This includes the class diagrams which gives an overview about the whole project.
## 2. Architectural Representation
As we develop a Chross-Plattform mobile ab MVVM is the pattern of choice.
It allows us to decouple the UI (View) from the Business Logic (Model/ViewModel).

Xamarin provides MVVM for our purposes.

## 3. Architectural Goals and Constraints
As we use Xamarin we don't have any MVC tool.
## 4. Use-Case View
### 4.1 Use-Case Realizations

## 5. Logical View
### 5.1 Overview

### 5.2 Architecturally Significant Design Packages
The class diagram; containing all Data Access Objects, Models and Controllers that we will need to finish for the basic functionality:

### 5.3 Pattern
Weâ€™ve choosen a service locator pattern to be used on our server. This pattern is typical for C#.

The service locator pattern is a design pattern used in to encapsulate the processes involved in obtaining a service with a strong abstraction layer. 

This pattern uses a central registry known as the "service locator", which on request returns the information necessary to perform a certain task.

The approach simplifies component-based applications where all dependencies are cleanly listed at the beginning of the whole application design, consequently making traditional dependency injection a more complex way of connecting objects.

Therefore we rebuild our InfrastructureInitializer to a SocketServerFactory.

As we already used some patterns since the beginning of development, we decided not to compromise the code integrity completely. Therefore not realy much changed in our code.
